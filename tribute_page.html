      <div class="main-text">

        <p>Joseph Saddler - born on January 1, 1958 - migrated with his family to the South Bronx from the Caribbean Island of Barbados. Noticing her sons curiosity with electronics, Saddlers mother encouraged Joseph to attend Samuel L. Gompers H.S. which taught its students electronic theory and how to repair electronic equipment. While he may have been unaware at the time, this knowledge would be very useful when setting up sound systems in the school yards for the many block parties he would host in the future.</p>

        <p>Saddler's father was a big fan of Caribbean and Black American records. As a child, Saddler was fascinated by his father's record collection. In an interview, he reflected: "My father was a very heavy record collector. He still thinks that he
          has the stronger collection. I used to open his closets and just look at all the records he had in awe." Saddler's early interest in DJ’ing stems from this very obsession.</p>

        <p>After high school, he attended the infamous parties held at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the West Bronx, the official “birthplace of hip-hop”, where he was inspired by DJ Kool Herc and his "merry go round". Herc turned bargain-bin oddities like the Incredible Bongo Band’s Apache and Babe Ruth’s The Mexican into must-have anthems by stringing together the percussive parts of  each record - called the "get-down part" or "break" - creating an extended instrumental background for emcees to say their rhymes and dancers to revel. "Before hip-hop was a genre it was a way of saying genre didn’t matter: a new dancefloor ideology" recalls Saddler.</p>

        <p> During the 1970’s New York saw its economy suffer as businesses and residents moved to nearby suburbs and public services such as police and fire departments were pared down leading to high crime rates and arson in the South Bronx. Amid this social and economic despair there were glimmers of creative hope all around. Saddler fondly recalls his adolescence on Fox Street, not far from the embattled police precinct known as Fort Apache, saying, “It was wonderful. It was like a village. Everybody knew each other. One of our biggest pastimes was flying kites on the roof. Where the gangs lived, that’s where the rubble was. You didn’t go there. But for me,” he grins, “it was a great place to live.”</p>

        <p>Early New York party DJs discovered that these short drum breaks were popular with party audiences. Aiming to isolate these percussive "breaks" and extend them for longer durations, Flash learned that by using duplicate copies of the same record, he could play the break on one turntable while searching for the same fragment of music on the other (using his headphones). When the break finished on one record, he used his mixer to switch quickly to the other record, where the same beat was cued up and ready to play. Using the backspin technique (also referred to as beat juggling), the same short phrase of music could be looped indefinitely. Flash's "Quick Mix Theory" grew out of this technique.</p>

        <p>Flash approached it as a science - The Quick Mix theory - 4bf = 6rc = loop. Four bars forward equaled six rotations counterclockwise equaled a loop. He quit dating and parties to spend every spare minute in his room, innovating radical turntable techniques that would enable him to cut between breaks with unprecedented speed and precision. “I had to violate all the laws of how you treat vinyl,” he says. Audiences weren’t instantly persuaded but Flash learned from older disco DJ Pete “DJ” Jones how to read and respond to the dancers’ needs and recruited Keith “Cowboy” Wiggins as his “town crier”, the first member of the MC crew that would become the Furious Five.</p>

        <p>In the mid 70’s Melle Mel (Melvin Glover, the first rapper to call himself "MC" or Master of Ceremony) and Kid Creole (Nathaniel Glover), were enlisted to team up with Cowboy and, for a time, the ensemble went by the name "Grandmaster Flash & the 3 MCs". They were eventually joined by Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams) and Scorpio a.k.a. Mr. Ness (Eddie Morris) finally completing the Furious Five MC’s. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five pioneered MC’ing and freestyle battles. Some of the staple phrases in MC’ing have their origins in the early shows and recordings of the group. In 1978, the new group began performing regularly at Disco Fever in the Bronx, one of the first times a hip-hop group was given a weekly residency at a well-known venue.</p>

        <p>Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were signed to Bobby Robinson's Enjoy Records and in 1979 released their first single, "Superrappin'". The following year they signed to Sugar Hill Records and began touring and releasing numerous singles.
          The seminal "The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel", released in 1981, is a 7-minute solo showcase of Grandmaster Flash's virtuosic turntable skills, combining elements of Blondie's "Rapture," Michael Viner's Incredible
          Bongo Band's "Apache," Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust," Chic's "Good Times," and the group's own "Freedom." It is also the first documented appearance of scratching on a record.</p>

        <p>Flash continues to innovate DJ technology by creating devices such as the Flash Former a popular DJ tool, has his own clothing line, and even appears in the video game DJ Hero as a playable character along with original mixes created for the game. In spite of all his success Flash is humbled by how far this music as gone “I didn’t think that way,” he says. “It was very home-grown, very organic. Thinking big business? No way! We was just thinking, where’s the next party at? I didn’t realise that what I was doing on the turntables would create a musical bed so guys could talk on it and it would become hip-hop. Who would even think that?”</p>
